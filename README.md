# TwoBodyConeImpactData
Data that goes along with the paper "Tuning body shape and stiffness to mitigate water-entry forces" https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13262 


The file names are encoded to represtent the experiment performed:

    For example: SF60025 (position 0123456)

0 -> S=Smooth <br />
1 -> F=Firm(7.8N/mm), S=Soft(1.7N/mm), R=Rigid <br />
23 -> Half angle cone, ranging from 10-80 <br />
456 -> The drop hight in cm ranging from 025-175 cm <br />
